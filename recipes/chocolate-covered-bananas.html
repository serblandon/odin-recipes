        <!-- Ingredients heading-->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ripe medium bananas</li>
            <li>1 ½ cup dark chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon refined coconut oil</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>Toppings (optional): 2 tablespoons each crushed peanuts, crushed pistachios, and all natural sprinkles</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Steps heading-->
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Freeze the bananas (45 minutes):</b> Slice bananas into 1/4-inch rounds. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and freeze for 45 minutes. </li>
            <li><b>Melt the chocolate:</b>Start a pot of simmering water. Place the chocolate, coconut oil, and salt in a glass measuring cup or large wide mouth jar, and place it into the simmering water. Very carefully, stir the chocolate until it melts, using a hot pad or gloves to hold the glass. Do not let any of the water splash, or it will split the chocolate.</li>
            <li><b>Dip and top the bananas:</b>Make sure your toppings are ready, if using. Leave the jar in the double boiler to keep the chocolate warm. Use a fork to dip each banana slice into the jar, then shake off excess chocolate.  Transfer the slice to the parchment lined baking sheet, using your finger to gently slide off the banana. Add toppings immediately (the chocolate freezes quickly) — this process is easiest with 2 people, 1 person to dip and 1 person to top.</li>
            <li><b>Freeze:</b> Return the bananas to the freezer and freeze for 30 minutes. Then transfer the banana bites to a freezer safe container.  Store up to 1 month.</li>
