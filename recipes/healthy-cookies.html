        <p>Yes, it's possible with these <b>Healthy Oatmeal Cookies!</b></p>
        <!-- Ingredients heading-->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup shredded unsweetened coconut</li>
            <li>2 cups Old Fashioned oats</li>
            <li>1 cup Medjool dates</li>
            <li>½ cup cashew butter (or other nut butter or sunflower butter)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>¼ cup plain or Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>¼ cup mini chocolate chips <i>(or more if desired)</i>, plus 1 tablespoon for topping</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Steps heading-->
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li><b>Toast the coconut:</b> Place the coconut in a small dry skillet (no oil) over medium heat. Heat, shaking the pan and stirring often with a wooden spoon, until the coconut is fragrant and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Stay at the stove because the coconut can easily burn! Remove immediately from the heat and transfer to a plate to stop the cooking.</li>
            <li>Place 1 cup of the Old Fashioned oats in a food processor and process until finely ground into a flour. Remove to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Remove the pits from the Medjool dates. Add them to the food processor with the nut butter, vanilla and salt. Process crumbly and fully combined, stopping and scraping the bowl once.</li>
            <li>Add the egg and yogurt and pulse until combined.</li>
            <li>Add the processed oat flour, remaining 1 cup whole oats, baking soda, and cinnamon and pulse until a thick dough forms. Stir in the toasted coconut and chocolate chips with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Make 20 small balls and place them on a parchment-lined cookie sheet: it’s easiest using a 1 ½ tablespoon / size 40 cookie scoop, if you have it. For a flatter cookie, gently press down with your hand (we left them as the domed of the cookie scoop). Gently press in the remaining 1 tablespoon mini chocolate chips to the tops of the cookies.</li>
            <li>Bake 12 to 15 minutes until golden brown, rotating the pan after 7 minutes. Allow to cool on a baking rack. To store, place the cookies in a sealed container lined with paper towels between the cookies at room temperature for up to 1 week, or refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.</li>
        </ol>
